This repository contains the semester long project for the class CSCI 5115 - User Interface Design. This class took place in Spring 2020 and these projects were coded in Java.

Projects for this class involved groups and I was on Team 3 with Nicholas Willette,  Jayden Alstad, Noah Oâ€™Brien, Dain LaRock, and Xin Rao. 

The semester long project was a Political Resource Finder app.
